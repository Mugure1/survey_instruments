# survey_instruments
Following a trade fair exhbition in 2023, I developed and designed a questionnaire to assess the quality of the experience for various stakeholders. The questionnaire was distributed to all stakeholders who participated in the exhbition during the 4 days. 
The questionnaire was instrumental in measuring the quality of the exhbition under a set KPI, an opportunity to gather feedback from the stakeholders. The data collected will inform organizers and hosts on key improvement areas to deliver an event that meets and surpassess the expectations of the clients and mutually benefit them.
